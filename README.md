# Polar 2 Cartesian Converter
## Description
Converts Polar Coordinates into Cartesian Coordinates.

## Mechanics
- Feeds on data from user selected csv file;
- applies fix for Illustrator;
- applies rotation of Y-axis if needed;
- Calculates translation of coordinate systems;
- Produces csv file;

## Instructions
Use import.csv that comes with the app to create your own import file, save with radius, polar, alpha columns.
Do not use the raw_polar column, as it is there only for specific calculation with image being only visible from a specific view. The excel table provides simple solution to this by switching X and Y coordinates and accounting -12.859 degrees of sheer of the original image.

## Dependancies
pandas, Python 3.x

## Story
I created it out of pure interest to see how python is working and I needed an app that converts Polar coordinates of stars based on an image of the galaxy that I created earlier ;)
